# **Course Overview**

**How to Speak Bot: Prompt Patterns** is a volunteer-built Humanitarians AI course that teaches the foundational, intermediate, and advanced **prompt engineering patterns** every learner needs to become AI fluent.

This course is the practical companion to the Botspeak Framework and the Nine Pillars of AI Fluency. Volunteers build labs, examples, and YouTube lessons based on the book’s chapters.

The course evolves through:

* Chapter → Lesson outlines
* Pattern demonstrations
* GitHub-hosted notebooks
* Prompt pattern labs
* Humanitarians Courses GPT–generated slides & scripts
